Prerequisites
=============

Gnome Commander requires the following packages:

- A working GNOME platform including glib 2.66, gtk+ 2.24, and gio 2.0
- meson

Gnome Commander can also make use of the following packages:

- libunique 0.9.3 or newer
- libexiv2
- taglib
- libgsf
- poppler
- samba-client
- yelp for documentation

Many package managers provide a way to install all the build dependencies for
a package, such as 'dnf builddep' or 'apt-get build-dep', which will install
almost all of the above.  The requirements may have changed slightly between
the version packaged in the distribution and the current development version,
so you might have to install some additional packages.


Simple install procedure
========================

  % meson setup builddir                         # prepare the build
  % meson compile -C builddir                    # build Gnome Commander
  % meson install -C builddir                    # install Gnome Commander

This installs Gnome Commander to the default directory, usually under
'/usr/local/bin/'.

By default, the build will enable optional features if the packages they require
are installed. To check which options are available and which are enabled,
run 'meson configure builddir'.

Changing project options would then work as follows:
  % meson configure builddir -Doption=value

Uninstall procedure
===================

If you want to uninstall Gnome Commander again, run as root:

  % ninja -C builddir uninstall
