// General

* Presentation of address bar via string or as icons as in thunar
* MIME configuration
* Browsing of compressed archives
* Tab completion at the built-in command line
* Splitting/merging files
* Optional deleting to .Trash
* Unmounting a device via device button
* advrename & FAM: do not re-sort file list for every single renamed file
* Bookmark icons for ordinary folders in the device toolbar
* User defined categories for grouping bookmarks (Firefox bookmark folders)
* Editing remote files
* Optional file deselection after completed action (copy, rename, ...)
* More plugins:
    - converting gz <-> bz2, tar.gz <-> tar.bz2
    - image operations (rotation, scaling, etc.) on selected files
    - batch file processing
    - converting txt <-> pdf
    - other mc-like extensions ?
* vfolders for selecting files from arbitrary URI
  (visible file selection can be merged internally to the vfolder at any point,
   and then the usual multiple file actions can be applied)
* Manageable queue for file transfers (pause/resume/cancel & rate limits)


// Data presentation

* File names filtering
* Custom columns support
    - support for file meta tags (exif, iptc, icc, mp3, vorbis, *ml, pdf, video, ...)
* 'Directory Tree' with ALT+F10
* Brief file listing (see mc)
* Thumbnail listing mode
* 'Subdirectory View' - showing contents of a given dir and all its
  subdirs in one file list. It gives the possibility of mass operation
  like: copy/move/rename/delete for all subdirs files. _Very_ handy.


// Advrename tool

* Support for file meta tags (icc, *ml, video, ...)
* Support for rename conflicts (file01->file02, file02->file03, ...)

// Shortcuts (testet with gcmd 1.2.8.15)

* The working status may depend on the window manager shortcuts!
* = does not select files with a pattern, instead "+" does this now
* CTRL+= does not work
* It is unclear what SHIFT+ENTER does (It should "Execute command 
  line in the defined terminal and leaves the terminal window open")
* CTRL+` (Go to home directory) is not working
* SUPER+1 (Change left connection) and SUPER+2 (Change right connection 
  show no reaction, ALT+1 and ALT+2 do
* CTRL+SHIFT+C seams not to copy anything...
* CTRL+SHIFT+. (Copy the current working directory from the active file 
  list to the inactive one) -> nothing happens
* CTRL+5 (Create MD5 checksum) -> Error message "Python module gnomevfs 
  ('gnome.vfs') could not be loaded"
* CTRL+K (Delete to the end of the command line) -> no reaction
* CTRL+W (Delete the word to the left of the cursor) -> no reaction
* CTRL+T (Delete the word to the right of the cursor) -> no reaction
* ALT+F8 (A list with the latest command lines (history list) is opened... -> no reaction 


// Internal viewer

* Adding the toolbar
* Multiple files browsing
* Preloading consecutive images
* Load search history for hex mode


Discussed stuff
-----------------------------------------------

* Toolbar configuration - OO.org like
* Light version of gc (based on gtk+ only - not depending on GNOME)
* Even lighter version of gc (statically linked, based on FLTK http://fltk.org/)
