// Shortcuts (testet with gcmd 1.2.8.15)

* The working status may depend on the window manager shortcuts!
* F1 is not working in xfce4 (error message pops up)
* = does not select files with a pattern, instead "+" does this now
* CTRL+= does not work
* It is unclear what SHIFT+ENTER does (It should "Execute command 
  line in the defined terminal and leaves the terminal window open")
* CTRL+` (Go to home directory) is not working
* SUPER+1 (Change left connection) and SUPER+2 (Change right connection show no reaction, ALT+1 and ALT+2 do
* CTRL+SHIFT+C seams not to copy anything...
* CTRL+SHIFT+. (Copy the current working directory from the active file list to the inactive one) -> nothing happens
* CTRL+5 (Create MD5 checksum) -> Error message "Python module gnomevfs ('gnome.vfs') could not be loaded"
* CTRL+K (Delete to the end of the command line) -> no reaction
* CTRL+W (Delete the word to the left of the cursor) -> no reaction
* CTRL+T (Delete the word to the right of the cursor) -> no reaction

* ALT+F8 -> no reaction (A list with the latest command lines (history
                list) is opened.  Use the UP and DOWN cursor keys to
                select an entry. By pressing the LEFT or RIGHT key, you
                can edit the command line. This automatically closes the
                list) -> The LEFT and RIGHT key is not workin
                either. Just use the ENTER key here.

// General

* MIME configuration
* Browsing of compressed archives
* Tab completion at the built-in command line
* Splitting/merging files
* Write bookmark changes immediately to file
* Optional deleting to .Trash
* Unmounting a device via device button
* advrename & FAM: do not re-sort file list for every single renamed file
* Bookmark icons for ordinary folders in the device toolbar
* User defined categories for grouping bookmarks (Firefox bookmark folders)
* Editing remote files
* Optional file deselection after completed action (copy, rename, ...)
* More plugins:
    - creating tarballs from selected files
    - compressing/decompressing (gz & bz2)
    - converting gz <-> bz2, tar.gz <-> tar.bz2
    - image operations (rotation, scaling, etc.) on selected files
    - batch file processing
    - converting txt <-> pdf
    - other mc-like extensions ?
* vfolders for selecting files from arbitrary URI
  (visible file selection can be merged internally to the vfolder at any point,
   and then the usual multiple file actions can be applied)
* Manageable queue for file transfers (pause/resume/cancel & rate limits)


// Data presentation

* File names filtering
* Custom columns support
    - support for file meta tags (exif, iptc, icc, mp3, vorbis, *ml, pdf, video, ...)
* 'Directory Tree' with ALT+F10
* Brief file listing (see mc)
* Thumbnail listing mode
* 'Subdirectory View' - showing contents of a given dir and all its
  subdirs in one file list. It gives the possibility of mass operation
  like: copy/move/rename/delete for all subdirs files. _Very_ handy.


// Search tool

* File search - advanced criteria (according to file size, date or attr)
* Support for file meta tags (exif, iptc, icc, mp3, vorbis, *ml, pdf, video, ...)


// Advrename tool

* Support for file meta tags (icc, *ml, video, ...)
* Support for rename conflicts (file01->file02, file02->file03, ...)


// Internal viewer

* Adding the toolbar
* Multiple files browsing
* Preloading consecutive images


Discussed stuff
-----------------------------------------------

* Toolbar configuration - OO.org like
* Light version of gc (based on gtk+ only - not depending on GNOME)
* Even lighter version of gc (statically linked, based on FLTK http://fltk.org/)
